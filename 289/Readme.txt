Solution Analysis:

Not in place:
Time Complexity : O(m*n)
Space Complexity: O(m*n)
----------------------------------------------------------------
In-place:
Use 2 stand for LIVEVERSA(original is live, after status is dead)
USe 3 stand for DEADVERSA(original is dead, after status is live)
Besides these two situations, no need to change the current status

Time Complexity: O(m*n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
